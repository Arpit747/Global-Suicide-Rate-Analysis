## 📦 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is originally from [Kaggle - Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szamil/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016), and contains:

## 📌 Key Features of the Dashboard
- Interactive filters for country, gender, and year.
- Line and bar charts showing suicide trends over time.

- Country-wise comparisons using heat maps.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau Public** – For data visualization
- **MS Excel / CSV** – For basic preprocessing

## 📈 Insights Discovered
- Higher suicide rates are observed among males compared to females.
- Some countries exhibit a consistent rise in suicide rates over the years.
- The age group **35-54** often records higher suicide numbers.
- GDP alone does not directly correlate with suicide rates, indicating complex socio-economic interactions.

## 🚀 How to Use
